- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gthalhamer!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a new, self-taught developer and new mom! My background is a fun mix of biochemistry and marketing/design, a combo which led me to the world of web development. 
      I've been using Codecademy Pro to learn the basics of JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, SQL, and test-driven development. 
   
- ðŸŒ± Check out some of my Codecademy and personal projects!
